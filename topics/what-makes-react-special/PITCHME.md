- We are creating our own HTML-type elements |
- The HTML is within the JavaScript (JSX) |

### What React gives you

+++

### React is only the view layer

- React components are just functions that accept input and return UI output (JSX is sugar) |
- React components can internally have their own state (opt-in) |

+++

### React uses a virtual DOM

- React maintains its own copy of the DOM in JavaScript |
- Only changes are sent to the browser to be updated |
- Calling setState only re-renders from call site and below |

+++

### React focuses on separation of concerns rather than separation of technologies

- HTML and JS are together |
- They actually work together |

+++

### React gives you readable, maintainable code

- Everything is a component |
